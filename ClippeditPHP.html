<p class="overview-text">The concept of this site is users can upload clips that they have recorded via their game consoles, which they can enter into a category such as action, thriller etc and then for said clip to be voted by the Clippedit community to potentially win IRL console currency such as Microsoft Points, PSN store vouchers etc.</p>
<br>
<p class="overview-text">I created this site to show that I can create a site that has user interactivity and the ability to use localhost databases to implement a login system (PHP) to allow users the option to register and log into the site.</p>

<p class="overview-text">Technologies and libraries used for the project was HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Git and PHP. The web editor tool used to create this project was Brackets Web Editor. When planning the design of the website I was looking at other websites for inspiration on how to make the site more engaging for users of a younger audience. One site stood out to me when looking for inspiration for the creation of my site and that was a website called plink.com. The use of animation and engaging user interaction was what I wanted to carry over to the Clippedit site. Therefore, I included interactive elements that can be altered and animate when clicked or hovered over. </p>
<br>
<p class="overview-text">On the landing page there is cards that flip over to reveal the Clippedit tag lines when hovered over. The ‘win it’ section allows users to move the mouse around and particles will appear as it there are fireworks on the screen. I wanted to connote to the user that with the tag line win it and the golden particles appearing from the mouse it indicates a trophy celebration with the addition of the background being black and the font becoming gold as gold represents winning, glory and triumph.
<br>
<br>
The site is not responsive to laptops, tablets and smartphones and can only be viewable on desktops as I only planned for this to be catered towards desktop users. At first, I was going to use smooth scroll until I found a git library that used Animate on Scroll (AOS) which I thought would complement the modern sleek look to how a everyday modern site is. To add to the previous point (AOS) creates a much more modern and smoother look to the site and is easy on the eye for the user. 
<br>
<br>
With the creation of the database login system an error message was added to show the user what the issue is when they fail to login or sign up. In the future I would alter the function of the error messages to pop up via a modal with the error reasoning clearly stated to them instead of it being shown in the URL.
